*** Sticky Notes for the Gde2 Desktop Environment. ***

This Gde2 panel applet allows you to create, view, and maintain sticky
notes on your Gde2 Desktop. Each note is "sticky" (appears on all workspaces),
has a date stamp, and can be freely moved around your desktop. The notes are
automatically saved and will reappear in their original locations (with their
original dimensions) when the Gde2 Desktop is restarted.

Right-click on a sticky note's title or on the StickyNotes applet for
self-explanatory options.
